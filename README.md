## ERL - Evolved Reinforcement Learner

=================================================================

### SETUP:

To get started with ERL, you need your favorite compiler and CMake (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).

Set CMake's source code directory to the ERL directory (the one that contains the /source folder as well as a CMakeLists.txt).

Set CMake's build directory to the /build/ directory (inside /ERL/).

Then press configure, and choose your compiler.

If the configuration did not result in errors, you can press configure again, and then hit generate. This will generate files necessary for your compiler in the /build/ directory.

You should then be able to compile and execute the program. If you are using Visual Studio, you may have to set your startup project to the ERL project.
